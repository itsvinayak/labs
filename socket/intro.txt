Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on
a network to communicate with each other.

what are socket ?

A network socket is an internal endpoint for sending or
receiving data within a node on a computer network.
_______________________________________________________________

two nodes are :
server and client

1) One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP,
   while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.
2) Server forms the listener socket while client reaches
   out to the server.

thing we need to do :

two files server.c and client.c

in server.c

create a socket
set socket options
bind socket to address and post
(in our case it will be localhost:8080)
listen to that post
and accept connection.

in client.c
create a socket connection.
and connect mostly same
